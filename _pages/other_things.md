## Some friends

Most of my friends are engineers (cf. "something unimportant"), it is a pity that those interesting minds don't have personal websites.

## About me

I love exploring new places – either alone or with friends — especially those with beautiful scenery (and particularly CSIDH). I often spend some time wandering around [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and knocking on blue doors there. I also enjoy solving [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), (repeatedly) reading the novels by [Jing Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong), and watching [MLB](https://www.mlb.com).

Mandarin and Taiwanese are my mother tongues, and two other languages are a work in progress.

During the dark and discouraging application year(s) (not yet ended...), only the following researchers were willing to spend time offering "real" help. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to them here.

<ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-top: 1em;">
<li> I'd especially like to thank Póoor for his incredible kindness toward an unfamiliar student and for taking the time to discuss math with me.</li>

<li> I'd also like to thank Dr. Ooooi and Dr. Mooooa, who consistently offered many valuable and practical suggestions. A huge thank also goes to Prof. Tooooi; he helped me recognize my many shortcomings in cryptography and provided me with a great deal of advice and recommended readings.  </li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;" ><li>Names have been partially anonymized, as I did not seek their explicit consent; however, I believe they will recognize that the references are to them.</li></span>
</ul>

<em> I hope that being a warm and kind person like them will always come before being a researcher. </em>

<ul>If people ask me whom I admire or respect most, my answer is Prof. Wei. His erudition is truly impressive, and everything he has told or suggested to me has been insightful and correct. It is an honor for me to know such a wonderful person.</ul>

<ul>It sounds poetic and beautiful though I'm not familiar with knot theory.</ul>

<ul>
    <li>I studied electrical engineering at a vocational high school (similar to Germany's Berufsfachschule) for a year. I switched to a regular high school because I kept causing short circuits in the lab. But it was a very funny year, I made many long-term friends there, and the number in my email address is my student ID there.</li>
    <li>Due to the broken circuit between my brain and my hands, I later focused on purely theoretical subjects.</li>
    <li>I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelung">Keelung</a>, which is also known as the "city of rain." There is a joke that people from Keelung always carry an umbrella. Well, this is true for me, so if anyone is caught in unexpected rain, one can just find me first. By the way, if you plan a trip to northern Taiwan, be sure to set aside some time for the stunning coastline!</li>
