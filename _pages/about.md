Hello! My name is Min-Yi.

📢 I am looking for a doctoral position!

📚 My research interests include:

- Algorithmic number theory
- Isogeny-based cryptography

🎓 I obtained my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics. During my Master's program, I served as a research assistant at CITI, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

I apologize for the lack of interesting information on this website (please feel free to send me an email). More details will be here someday — I am currently unsure how to protect myself and all the names (especially women) mentioned here from harassment by X2 below.

## Contact Me

Except for X1 and X2 below, please feel free to contact me about anything!!!

✉️ My email: min.yi.shen0403106-at-gmail.com

Even just a simple "hi" is welcome! I really enjoy talking to people!

- X1: Any commercial advertisements.
- X2: {Abbreviation of the first name: S.-N.}$$\,\cap\,$${Completed PhD in Mathematics at Uni DuE}$$\,\cap\,$${Last name: Tung}.
  
  - If you (especially women) receive an email from this person (or anyone connected to him), we — all the students who know him — strongly recommend that you ignore it, no matter what he says. Any response tends to lead to endless disturbances. I feel truly sorry for the kind people around me.
